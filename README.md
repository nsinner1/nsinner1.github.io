# Natalie's Learning Journal

###### My name is Natalie Sinner. I come from the automotive industry. I currently work for Tesla. My computer operating system is macOS Catalina Version 10.15.1. I am expecting to learn more about coding.

Growth mindset is being used **open**. Being willing to **accept** change and ideas. Accepting that things are **different** and can be done differently.  

1. Being open
2. No judgement 
3. Just say _thank you_

## Read: 03 - Revisions and the Cloud (Git)

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.
  + Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files
  + Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. Allows to create mirrored repositories.
  
 Snapshots/Commit - Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit 
 Local Operations - a project’s history resides on the local disk (no VPN necessary) 
 Tracking Changes - Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. (Accountability!!!!)
 Loss of Data - Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
 3 States of Git
  + Committed - Data is securely stored in a local database
  + Modified - File has been changed but not committed to the database
  + Staged - Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

## Read: 04 - Structure web pages with HTML

The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
● A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. (article, blog entry, comment and form post)

When the <aside> element
is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. 
When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. 

The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

Each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using 

Add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser <"!-- comment goes here --"> (NO QUOTATION MARKS)

Display Types
    + Block - takes up entire space it is housed/contained in
    + Inline - the space of each element of itself 

The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.    

The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. 


    
## Cheat sheet
+ ls -l:	list with long format - show permissions
+ in VS Code: command, shift, p click shell command 
+ file.exe - an executable file, or program.
+ file.txt - a plain text file.
+ file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
+ cd = change directory
+ Start typing then hit tab instead of type whole command

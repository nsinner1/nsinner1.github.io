# Natalie's Learning Journal

###### My name is Natalie Sinner. I come from the automotive industry. I currently work for Tesla. My computer operating system is macOS Catalina Version 10.15.1. I am expecting to learn more about coding.

Growth mindset is being used **open**. Being willing to **accept** change and ideas. Accepting that things are **different** and can be done differently.  

1. Being open
2. No judgement 
3. Just say _thank you_

## Read: 03 - Revisions and the Cloud (Git)

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.
  + Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files
  + Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. Allows to create mirrored repositories.
  
 Snapshots/Commit - Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit 
 Local Operations - a project’s history resides on the local disk (no VPN necessary) 
 Tracking Changes - Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. (Accountability!!!!)
 Loss of Data - Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
 3 States of Git
  + Committed - Data is securely stored in a local database
  + Modified - File has been changed but not committed to the database
  + Staged - Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot


## Cheat sheet
+ ls -l:	list with long format - show permissions
+ in VS Code: command, shift, p click shell command 
+ file.exe - an executable file, or program.
+ file.txt - a plain text file.
+ file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
+ cd = change directory
+ Start typing then hit tab instead of type whole command
